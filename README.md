# data-serving-mongodb

This repository serves as a hardware/cloud agnostic example for deployment MongoDB clusters using Git, Terraform Enterprise/Cloud, and Nomad Enterprise.  All you need is a Linux OS to get started.  For HA or whatever the availability zones need to be considered, deployment can be easily adapted to allocate across fault zones and support database isolation without use of Hypervisor or Containers.
